# Hotel Bookings Analysis and Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and optimize hotel bookings data to improve data quality, generate meaningful insights, and support decision-making through advanced analytics and predictive modeling. The initial phase focuses on cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset, followed by building data pipelines, performing data transformations, and visualizing results.

## Objectives
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, standardize data formats, and detect outliers.

- Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends within the data.

- Data Pipeline: Develop a pipeline to process data in batch and real-time, optimizing performance for large datasets.

- Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict key metrics, such as booking cancellations and demand forecasting.

- Data Visualization: Create dashboards to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

- Name: HotelBookings.csv

- Description: A dataset containing hotel bookings information with fields such as booking dates, cancellation status, customer details, and room preferences.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites

Python: Recommended version 3.8 or higher.

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.

Database: Optional - SQL-based for data warehousing.
